# orderbook

A simple orderbook that connects to a websocket feed getting real time information about market data, and records bids and asks. Visualizes key metrics, including market momentum, through dynamic graphs. Currently working on a matching system for each order. To build, make a directory `build`, navigate into it, and run `cmake ..`.
